# Weather-Predictor.
I used the modeling tools of deseasonalization and linear regression to predict temperatures at the beach. I have used the statistical tools of autoregression and confidence intervals to guide our feature selection and apply results. A standalone weather predictor that can estimate high temperatures three days from now.
